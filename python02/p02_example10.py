# Define the temperature
temperature = 35  # You can change this value to test different conditions

# First if condition with two instructions
if temperature > 30:
    print("It's hot outside!")  # This instruction is executed if the condition is true
    print("Make sure to stay hydrated.")  # This instruction is also executed if the condition is true

# Second if condition with one instruction inside and one outside
if temperature < 20:
    print("It's cold outside!")  # This instruction is executed if the condition is true
print("Have a great day!")  # This instruction is executed regardless of the condition
